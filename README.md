TWU_ObjectInteractions
======================

Objectives : Understand some object interaction [Delegation, Collaboration, Interface, Inheritance] concepts.

Domain :
- Football game between teamA and teamB with Spectators [Fans, Reporter, ScoreBoard].
- The game reports to spectators for every goal : which team scored ?
- Spectators react differently :
      - Scoring team fan says 'Yay !'
          - Grumpy fan says '.... meh'
      - Other team fan says 'Boo !'
      - Reporter announces scores
      - Scoreboard updates score and displays it      

Session Plan : 
- Explain the domain [5 min]
- Group brainstorming about objects and processes [5 min]

[Delegation and Collaboration]  
Game knows which team scored, but it doesnt have anyone to report to.  
-> Enter Reporter who reports every score  
... hack hack ...  

[Interface]  
But there is no one supporting either team  
-> Enter fans for both teams  
-> The fans react differently to show support  
... hack hack ...   

We also need a scoreboard who needs to track the score   
-> Enter ScoreBoard   
... hack hack ...   

[Inheritance]   
Now there is a GrumpyFan in the audience who is indifferent when his/her team scores
